## Repository Setup instructions

To set up the repository, make sure to first set the use name and the e-mail.

## Repository Commits to Main

In order to upload files to the hosted website and back them up physically, a few helper scripts have been written. They should be executed as follows:

1. Commit & Copy **One** Markdown Files: `gcommit-md-xxx`
1. Push HTML to Origin & Copy Images: `gpush-html-images-xxx`

where `xxx` is `rec` for recipes and `dev` for development tools.
